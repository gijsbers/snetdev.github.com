Here you can download all the individual parts to build the S-Net tool chain.  
Everything you need to get up and running with S-Net is listed on the right.   
All parts, except for the compiler for the time being, are available as sources
and are licensed under the LGPL.

Have a look at the [How to Build Guide](content/howtobuild.html)
for step-by-step instructions on setting up your environment and compiling 
the required libraries.
